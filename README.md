# Bitbucket Repository Backup Script

Bash script to automatically backup all repositories and branches from a Bitbucket workspace, updated to support Atlassian's API Tokens.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Automatic repository discovery** - Fetches all repositories from your Bitbucket workspace
- üåø **All branches backup** - Backs up every branch in each repository
- üîê **Secure authentication** - Uses Atlassian API tokens for authentication
- üìä **Progress tracking** - Real-time progress bar and detailed logging
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error recovery** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ‚ö° **Parallel processing** - Configurable parallel job execution
- üîç **Backup verification** - Verify backups after completion
- üéØ **Dry-run mode** - Preview what would be backed up
- üìù **Comprehensive logging** - Colored, timestamped log messages
- üìà **Summary reports** - Detailed backup statistics and results

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd bitbucketbackup
   ```

2. **Create your configuration file:**
   ```bash
   cp config.env.example config.env
   ```

3. **Edit `config.env` with your Bitbucket credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Bitbucket Configuration
   ATLASSIAN_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
   API_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
   ORGNAME="your-workspace-name"
   BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/your/backup/directory"
   ```

4. **Run the backup:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x main.sh
   ./main.sh
   ```

## üìã Getting Your Bitbucket API Token

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings > Security > API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token with scopes"
3. Give the API token a name and set an expiry date, then click "Next"
4. Select "Bitbucket" as the app and click "Next"
5. Select the following scopes (permissions):
   - **Repositories: Read**
   - **Workspace membership: Read**
6. Click "Next" to review your token
7. Click "Create token"
8. Copy the generated API token and paste it in your `config.env` file

**Note:** API tokens are created through your Atlassian account settings, not through Bitbucket directly. They provide better security and are the recommended authentication method for Bitbucket APIs.

## üéõÔ∏è Command Line Options

```bash
Usage: main.sh [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help              Show this help message
    -c, --config FILE       Specify configuration file (default: config.env)
    -d, --dry-run          Show what would be done without executing
    -v, --verbose          Enable verbose output
    -s, --skip-existing    Skip repositories that already exist
    -j, --jobs N           Number of parallel jobs (default: 4)
    --verify               Verify backups after completion

EXAMPLES:
    ./main.sh                    # Run with default settings
    ./main.sh --dry-run          # See what would be backed up
    ./main.sh --verbose --jobs 8 # Verbose output with 8 parallel jobs
    ./main.sh --config my.env    # Use custom config file
    ./main.sh --verify           # Verify backups after completion
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Dry Run Mode
Preview what the script would do without making any changes:
```bash
./main.sh --dry-run
```

### Verbose Output
Get detailed information about each step:
```bash
./main.sh --verbose
```

### Parallel Processing
Speed up backups by running multiple repositories in parallel:
```bash
./main.sh --jobs 8  # Use 8 parallel jobs
```

### Skip Existing Repositories
Only backup new repositories, skip existing ones:
```bash
./main.sh --skip-existing
```

### Backup Verification
Verify that all backups are valid after completion:
```bash
./main.sh --verify
```

### Custom Configuration
Use a different configuration file:
```bash
./main.sh --config production.env
```

## üìä What Gets Backed Up

- ‚úÖ All repositories in your specified workspace
- ‚úÖ All branches in each repository (main, master, develop, feature branches, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Complete Git history and commits
- ‚úÖ All tags and refs
- ‚úÖ Repository metadata and structure

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- The `config.env` file is excluded from Git via `.gitignore`
- Never commit your actual API token to version control
- The example file (`config.env.example`) is safe to commit as it contains no real credentials
- All sensitive data is validated and sanitized before use

## üìà Performance Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Configurable number of concurrent repository backups
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for network operations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar and detailed statistics
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failures with detailed reporting
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes repositories one at a time to minimize memory usage

## üîç Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Network Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Authentication Errors**: Clear error messages for invalid credentials
- **Permission Issues**: Validation of backup directory permissions
- **Repository Access**: Handling of private repositories and access restrictions
- **Disk Space**: Validation of available disk space before backup

## üìã Requirements

- **Bash shell** (version 4.0 or higher)
- **Git** (version 2.0 or higher)
- **curl** (for API communication)
- **jq** (optional, for better JSON parsing)

## üìù Logging

The script provides comprehensive logging with different levels:

- **ERROR**: Critical errors that prevent operation
- **WARN**: Non-critical issues that don't stop execution
- **INFO**: General information about progress
- **SUCCESS**: Successful operations

All logs include timestamps and are color-coded for easy reading.
